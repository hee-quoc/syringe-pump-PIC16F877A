### This is my team Simple Project about a Syringe Pump using PIC16F877A to control 
## Main Programmer: MPLAB, PICkit2
First, you need to download the MPLAB. Here, I'm using **MPLAB X IDE v6.15**. The version you can download here [https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide]
Second, the PICkit2 I am using here, you can get this link [https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/pg164120]
Third, let's rock to the code :)
