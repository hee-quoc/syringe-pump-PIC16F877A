### This is my team Simple Project about a Syringe Pump using PIC16F877A to control 
## Main Programmer: MPLAB, PICkit2
1. You need to download the MPLAB. Here, I'm using **MPLAB X IDE v6.15**. The version you can download here [https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide]
2. The PICkit2 I am using here, you can get this link [https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/pg164120]
3. Let's rock to the code :) 
* The final result you can get after doing this project: ![final-result](https://github.com/hee-quoc/syringe-pump-PIC16F877A/assets/154273947/01863f8e-c407-40b5-9137-0a7dec77add7)
> [!NOTE]
> You should download and check the voltage of PICkit2. It is very important to check the VDD, VCC,..

> [!TIP]
> Check the table of PICkit2 to run.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> The voltage is kinda hot, be careful!

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
